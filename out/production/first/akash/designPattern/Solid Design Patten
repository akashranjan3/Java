Pillars of SDP(Solid Design Patten)

Single Responsibility Principle -> The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor
Open-Closed Principle -> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle -> The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
Interface Segregation Principle -> no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
Dependency Inversion Principle -> The principle consists of two core concepts: high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, and both should depend on abstractions.
